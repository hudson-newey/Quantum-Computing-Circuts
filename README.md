# Quantum Computing Circuts (written in Quantum Assembly; OpenQASM)

## Shors Algorithm for Number Factorisation

Given an integer N, try to find another integer p between 1 and N that divides N

## Quantum Entangled Bell Pair

By measuring the state of one Qubit, it collapses the quantum wave function of a second Qubit irrespective of physical distance (you just performed quantum information teleportation!)
